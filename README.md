# PingPongGANN
An AI for PingPong using Neural network and Genetic Algorithm

You can watch the AI train from scratch (run.m) or you can just run the pretrained model (run_pretrained.m)

When run.m is run, it constantly shows new figures for each chromosome, so if you don't want to be distracted too much by the 
figures, you should dock it. First, type this command:
    figure
    
Then, dock the figure. 

Afterwards, type this command:
    set(0, 'DefaultFigureWindowStyle', 'docked');
    
Then run the file. The same goes for run_pretrained.m
